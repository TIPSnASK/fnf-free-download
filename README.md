# **[FNF Free Download](https://gamejolt.com/games/fridaynightfunkin/705302): Codename Engine Port**
**This is a fanmade port of FNF Free Download to Codename Engine.
Everything seen here (except the code) belongs Tyler_mon and the FNF Free Download team.**

*This port is only being made out of love and care for FNF Free Download, and nothing about this port intends to cause any harm. All development on this port will be stopped immediately if Tyler_mon or someone from the FNF Free Download team requests for it to be stopped.*

# Info
the port's being made on a dev build so some stuff probably wont work yet until the engine releasees an update publicly.
hopefully if everything goes right though, it'll work fine on public builds

im probably not gonna try to make it look pixel perfect considering how hard it is to make one game look like another, but i at least want it to be playable
