# **[FNF Free Download](https://gamejolt.com/games/fridaynightfunkin/705302): Codename Engine Port**
**This is a fanmade port of FNF Free Download to Codename Engine (with some extra things).
Everything seen here (except most of the code) belongs Tyler_mon, Funne, and Deklaswas.**

*This port is only being made out of love and care for FNF Free Download, and nothing about this port intends to cause any harm. All development on this port will be stopped immediately if someone from the FNF Free Download team requests for it to be stopped (my discord handle is cookie.sock if you need that).*

# Info
***IMPORTANT***<br>
**some base codename engine things might break considering the small resolution of the game**

**development on this started before free download was cancelled on 12/31/2023, so i have no clue if working on a port like this is allowed but im still gonna work on it for now i guess**

***THIS PORT USES THE `onDraw` FUNCTION!! SOME THINGS MAY BREAK IF YOU HAVENT COMPILED YOUR OWN CODENAME ENGINE BUILD***

***THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE ACTION BUILDS USE THE WRONG FLIXEL REPOSITORY. I REPORTED THE PROBLEM A WHILE AGO BUT I DONT KNOW IF THEY'RE FIXING IT OR NOT***

the port's being made on a dev build so some stuff probably wont work yet until the engine releases an update publicly.
hopefully if everything goes right though, it'll work fine on public builds

im probably not gonna try to make it look pixel perfect considering how hard it is to make one game look like another, but i at least want it to be playable
